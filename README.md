# ASR Transformer

This project is originally forked from <https://github.com/Kyubyong/transformer> and <https://github.com/chqiwang/transformer>.
We change it into ASR task. Five modeling units are compared on Mandarin Chinese ASR tasks with HKUST datasets by the ASR Transformer, including CI-phonemes, syllables, words, sub-words and characters.

## Usage
1)config your *.yaml; 2)python train.py; 3)python evaluate.py
